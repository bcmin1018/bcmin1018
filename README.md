### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working as an API and web backend developer. While pursuing my graduate studies, I have developed a keen interest in utilizing artificial intelligence for natural language processing.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and engaging in fitness activities interchangeably. 
I have a strong interest in maintaining my physical well-being. 
I believe that combining static development work with dynamic exercise can undoubtedly yield synergistic effects!
